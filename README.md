# Tic-Tac-Toe with Sizes
# by Eilon Lifshitz

# Rules:
 - The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
 - Normal tic-tac-toe rules
   - The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
   - When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
 - The diffrence:
   - Each player has 6 pieces with different sizes.
   - A player can choose to put a piece in a square if the square is empty or the piece is bigger (and not equal) than the piece in the square
   - A player can't put a piece ontop one of his pieces
  
  # Plans for the future:
 - [ ] Add different kind of bots
 - [ ] Add friendlier IO
 - [ ] Add baord size option (kinda easy)
